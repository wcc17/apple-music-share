To bring back electron:

There is a package.json.ELECTRON file in the root directory. 
Need the following lines under the script: value
    "electron": "ng build --base-href ./ && electron ."
See this after version as well:
    "main": "main.js",

    
The "main.js" file is for electron (also in root)
