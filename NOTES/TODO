For the server:
should not accept any messages dated before server start time. would need to be sending a timestamp from client
should disconnect any users trying to send messages that don't have a roomID (unless its create or join room of course)

For the client:
should be sending timestamps with every message to server
should disconnect the user from the room once three failed messages happen
